Dear $USERNAME,

Alongside this Email address was the password, $PASSWORD, if this is still your current password for the account you have been compromised for an unknown amount of time, since at least November of 2018.

You should change your password IMMEDIATELY, even if the password is old you may want to consider how long you have had your current password for; It is recommended to change your passwords about once a year, however, the real important aspect is that you do not reuse passwords across multiple websites.
